        "Pets and Animals: How to walk a big dog as a kid. Hold the leash with someone else. Before you're able to walk the dog on your own, go along for walks with your parents or older siblings who are big enough to handle the dog. Ask if you can help hold the leash. Some leashes, which can be found at pet stores or online, even have extra handles for this reason. You can also use 2 leashes-one for you and one for the adult.\n\nFinance and Business: How to get fast cash. Identify potential items for sale. Selling items is the quickest way to gain cash quickly, and it begins by looking for items you own that are either unused, unnecessary, or that you can simply do without. This can often be a difficult task, especially if you have a connection with your possessions or are keeping them for sentimental reasons. You need to decide whether having the cash or having the item is more important. Begin by asking yourself what your key needs are.\n\nYouth: How to act like sherlock holmes. Observe as many details as possible. Train yourself to observe anything and everything that crosses your path. When you enter a room, take in as much of the scene as you can. Notice things like the color of the wallpaper, the scent of the room, any noises you hear, and so on. Use all your senses to make thorough observations.\n\nPets and Animals: How to reduce excessive shedding in dogs. Feed your dog a high quality diet. One of the best ways to reduce excessive shedding in dogs is to start with a healthy diet. Cheap dog food is made mostly of fillers that dogs have difficulty digesting, such as corn and grains. Look instead for a dog food that lists meat as the main ingredient. Better quality foods cost a bit more upfront, but they're better for your dog for a variety of reasons.\n\nCars & Other Vehicles: How to use turtle wax. Wash your car before you wax it. Clean your car as thoroughly as you can on the outside. Use all the basic cleaners, such as soap and water for the body and window cleaner for your windows. By the time you finish, the body of your vehicle should be shiny and free of dirt. The turtle wax will work best when your car is spotless.\n\nPlaying badminton: A man serves a tennis ball on a tennis court. A player opposite of him hits the ball with his racket. The two men continuously play tennis until a point is scored.\n\nMaking a cake: Baker artist then mixes a liquid and another powder mixture together and gets a different color texture. The artist then paints on the liquid onto the entire fish cake. The artist shows a bottle of blue color liquid which he uses to paint stripes on to the fish cake.\n\nPets and Animals: How to encourage your dog to sleep in your bed. Allow your dog to sleep in the room. Do not invite your dog into the bed with you right away. For several reasons, this is a bad idea. You need to ease your dog into sleeping in your bed. Start by letting him in your room at night.\n\nFood and Entertaining: How to apply simple every day makeup. Wash your face. Before applying makeup in the morning, wash your face so you'll be able to start with a fresh canvas. Use a cleanser or simply splash lukewarm water on your face a few times to wash away any debris on your skin. Pat it dry gently with a soft towel. Avoid washing your face with hot water.\n\nRock climbing: A man comes onto the screen to introduce a video about rock climbing. He gets onto the rock and starts to show several different techniques for rock climbing.\n\nRunning a marathon: A camera pans away from a road and shows a person's feet moving around. Several shots",

Unplug the battery after each use.. Use the hard drive more than the cd/dvd drive. As power consuming as hard drives are, cd and dvd drives use more power than hard drives. Even having one in the drive can be power consuming. They spin, taking power, even when they are not actively being used.\n\nRelationships: How to find water. Look for areas that have green foliage.

The goalie mask has a cage, shell, and specific padding, while a player's mask generally consists of a cage or face mask. The cage or face mask is the most basic type of mask for a hockey player who is not a goalie. Usually a wire grid or clear polycarbonate shield covers the player's face, protecting him or her from flying pucks or errant sticks. The wire cage tends to impair the player's vision.\n\nHealth: How to grieve and move on. Acknowledge your loss.

Finding an attorney-let alone several possibilities-can be difficult if you have no idea where to start.

        "Relationships: How to make a grandparent happy. Know what your grandparent is capable of doing. Depending on how old your grandparent is, he may be limited in some respects. If you would like to spend time with your grandparent, be sure to plan for activities that your grandparent can easily do.  For example, if your grandparent needs to use a cane or walker to help him get around, then planning a morning walking around a local park is not a suitable idea. Your grandparent will not be able to walk for a long period of time and will need frequent rest breaks.\n\nYouth: How to not get stressed by school. Know when your stress has become unhealthy. Some stress can be a good thing; it encourages us to work harder and perform under high pressure situations. But too much stress can begin to hurt our health and make it harder for us to perform.  A good sign that you have become overly stressed is that you can no longer bounce back. It makes sense to be stressed the night before a test.\n\nYouth: How to argue with parents successfully. Pick your battles. You shouldn't argue with your parents every time you disagree with them, if only because this strategy will make it harder for you to win when the argument is about something that is really important to you. Weigh the benefits versus the costs. If the topic of the argument is significant to you, it might be worth the effort and the possible consequences of engaging in an argument with your parents. However, if there are minimal worthwhile results, it might be best to let this one go.\n\nHealth: How to take astragalus supplements. Take astragalus supplements for colds and seasonal allergies. You can take astragalus supplements for colds and influenza, as it has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties. However, in some cases, astragalus supplements can make a cold worse. Use caution when taking astragalus supplements for colds. If your symptoms do not improve in a few days, you may want to switch to a different medication.\n\nPainting furniture: A man is close up to the camera introducing the video. His wife is cleaning off a piece of white bedframe quickly. The man again shows his face and goes back to his wife.\n\nShaving: Kevin reaches into an envelope and pulls something out. Kevin is in a bathroom and partially shaves his beard, leaving an unusual pattern. Photos of him are shown from all sides.\n\nFood and Entertaining: How to lose weight while breastfeeding. Try to eat every three hours. It may seem counterintuitive, but it is important to eat regularly to lose weight. While nursing, you should never eat fewer than 1 , 500-1 , 800 calories daily, and most women require much more than this. Starving yourself is never a good idea, and is particularly dangerous when recovering from childbirth and nursing your baby. Too few calories can also be counterproductive to your weight loss goals.\n\nHealth: How to run safely in the summer. Get acclimated with the hotter weather. When you're used to either running indoors or during colder weather, the shock of a super hot and humid day can be tough on your body. Avoid this stress and get yourself acclimated to the summer heat.  When it gets closer to summer, you'll have a few really hot days pop up all of a sudden. Instead of going for a long run or doing speed work on these days, do an easier workout.\n\nPets and Animals: How to catch a stray kitten. Determine if the mother cat is nearby. When you see a kitten who appears to be alone, your first step is to figure out if the mother cat is still in the picture. It is possible that she has abandoned her kitten, but it could also be that she is simply out hunting for food. The only way to know whether the kitten is motherless is to wait. You will need to observe the situation for more than just a few minutes.\n\nHorseback riding: Another video is shown of the girl riding the horse indoors.

        "Pets and Animals: How to introduce a new pet rat to another rat. When you bring your new rat home, don't have it in the same room as your other rat until you're sure it won't pass on any diseases. Wash your hands between handling your rats. Some people choose to quarantine new rats from the others for several weeks.  When you're ready, place the new rat's cage in the same room as your other rat's cage, but about three feet away. This should get them curious about each other and used to seeing and smelling each other.\n\nFood and Entertaining: How to make healthy marshmallow sweet potatoes. Peel sweet potatoes, for instance with a potato peeler or knife. A small sharp non-serrated knife, preferably without a pointy point (to protect the user), is a good option. The skin is thin and the potatoes are hard, so take a narrow strip at a time to avoid jamming the knife and also to avoid wasting potato. Sweet potatoes are not very easy to peel safely so generally don't let a child do this.. Chop the sweet potatoes into disks about an inch thick.\n\nEducation and Communications: How to write a unit plan. Adopt unit plans to create connections for your students. At its most basic level, unit planning ensures you are linking each lesson plan to the next. As you develop a unit plan you'll support key concepts and learning goals with a carefully mapped structure.  Use unit planning to weave key concepts and learning goals together over time and between or among disciplines. Consider overlapping lessons with fellow instructors to provide longer spans of time for study and practice.\n\nHome and Garden: How to decide whether it is safe to escape during a fire. Plan your escape route ahead of time. Fire spreads quickly, and there may be no time during a fire to figure out an escape route. If bedrooms are on the second floor, be sure an escape ladder is near the window in each room. Designate 2 escape routes out of each room.. Practice your escape plan and safety rules with children often.\n\nComputers and Electronics: How to hire a nanny who won't hit on your spouse. Reach out to friends and family members. This is a good start if you're looking for a quality nanny. If you have friends and family members with children, you can ask them for recommendations. A close friend or family member is unlikely to suggest a nanny who's had issues with professionalism. They may be able to steer you in the direction of a nanny who's unlikely to hit on your husband.\n\nYouth: How to be friends with the people around you. Start with the people around your locker. These are the people who will be right next to you throughout the whole year, so even if you don't have any classes together, you'll still be able to talk. Start off with a simple' hi'. If you say this every time between classes/every time you're at your locker, the other person will become accustomed to you and it may lead to further conversation. After a few days, skip saying' hi' and see if they greet you first.\n\nFood and Entertaining: How to eat spaghetti. Take your fork in your dominant hand. Spaghetti can be eaten with nothing more than a single fork (in fact, this is how the italians do it). Almost any standard-sized dinner fork will work.  Catch a few strands of spaghetti in your fork. Lift your fork and, with a scooping motion, gather a small number of strands between the tines of the fork.\n\nHealth: How to exude confidence. Practice good posture. Posture actually has a big effect on the way others perceive you. If you sit up straight, you will look more comfortable. Slouching gives the impression of nervousness. Make an effort to be aware of your posture throughout the day so you will come off as confidence to those around you.\n\nHealth: How to improve kidney function. Eat a balanced diet. A healthy balanced diet is a major factor to good overall health, and kidney health is no exception. Avoid fatty and salty food, and eat lots of fresh fruit and vegetables. If you are unsure about what a balanced diet might look like, look at the food groups identified in the food pyramid and go from there. The original food pyramid has been criticised by public health experts, so you may want to look at the more recent healthy eating pyramid which combines healthy eating with weight control.\n\nTravel: How to book discount travel packages. Be flexible. You are more likely to find a deep discount on travel if you are open to a number of dates, locations and flight times. Discuss what is and is not flexible for you and your travel group.  Decide which services you would need in your package. A travel package can include airfare and hotels or they can include food, cars and sights.\n\nSharpening knives: A man wearing a black clothes is sharpening the knife on a stone.
