Then their population expanded because all the susceptible mosquitoes had been exterminated.\nC. DDT is generally a very effective insecticide.

Plants of the same genetic variety have flowers that range in color from blue to pink with the color varying due to the type of soil in which they are grown. Which of the following statement best explains this phenomenon?\nA. The alleles for flower color show incomplete dominance where neither trait is dominant; expression of the genes shows a blending of traits.\nB. The alleles for flower color are codominant; both traits show depending on the environment.\nC. In this case, the environment alters the expression of a trait.\nD.
