      "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?",

Medical history is unremarkable and the patient takes no medications or any other illicit drugs. He is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2 . The patient is diaphoretic. Vital signs are temperature 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F), pulse 110/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 200/100 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 95%. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion. Auscultation of the heart discloses an audible S1 and S2. There is no edema, cyanosis, or clubbing of the digits. The patient is fully oriented. He is treated with supplemental oxygen, a 325-mg aspirin tablet, and intravenous nitroglycerin and lorazepam. Despite therapy, he continues to have chest pain and shortness of breath.
