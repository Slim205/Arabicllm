        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about security studies.\nTo what extent can societal identity be defended militarily?\nA. If a threat posed by one group to another is military - particularly when linked to the defence of the historic homeland - armed response is required. At the intra-state level, many societal groups have no such means of armed protection and are compelled to employ non-military counter-measures.\nB. Intra-state collectives faced with a political or military threat to their identity will form their own militia or defensive force as a means of protection. This results in the establishment of quasi-states which may undermine the territorial integrity of the nation.\nC.

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about security studies.\nIn what ways have post-Cold War developments undermined state authority?\nA. The increased levels of globalization in trade, finance, and movement have produced an environment conducive to TNC by making it easier for criminals to move illicit profits and illegal goods, provide service, and smuggle persons across borders.\nB. The wave of political transitions to democracy and economic transitions to free market capitalism since the 1980s - a phenomenon which frequently occurred simultaneously in the same country - have undermined state capacity to enforce rule of law and created new opportunities for organized crime groups to penetrate societies in transition.\nC. The sharp increase in civil conflicts around the globe also created a new generation of refugees. These diasporas have provided the family and ethnic ties that help facilitate a transnational criminal enterprise.\nD. All of these options.\nAnswer:",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about security studies.\nWhen considering the international system from a realist perspective, which of the following statements concerning the advent of war is true?\nA. War is more likely to occur when a state is losing power, a decline in a state's ability to protect itself from attack, coercion and vulnerability increases its motivation to engage in aggressive behaviour.\nB. War may be more likely to occur in multipolar international systems where, among other reasons, states have the incentive and opportunity to buckpass.\nC. War is more likely when the offence-defence balance of the international system favours offence, thus creating a more competitive environment for states.\nD. All of these options.\nAnswer:",
